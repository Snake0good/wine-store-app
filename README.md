# wine-store-app
A mobile wine store app written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


This is a project that kept me busy for quite some time, but it's my first real app for a phone. Why did I do it on a webpage? I'm not sure, but it was just somethign that I knew I could do if I put the time and effort in. 

Hope you enjoy. 
Most of the thigns are written in HTML and then JS does the handling.
